    "In this assignment, we will be working with a Landsat 8 image of the Greenland Ice Sheet from Jul 24, 2015. The image can be downloaded from [here](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/jr555_duke_edu/EXhloccheWBEhVULB0DDhZ0BjhURBTBuJSIBSZhuMVJBUg?e=x5sGzL). There are three bands in this image corresponding to Blue, Green, and Red (in that order). \n",

    "## Task 1 (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* a) Open the `landsat-rgb.tif` file (i.e. `src = rasterio.open('data/landsat-rgb.tif')`). How many rows and columns are in this image?\n",
    "\n",
    "* b) What is the coordinate reference system of this image? What is the spatial resolution of this image?\n",
    "\n",
    "* c) Read each band as a separate variable (e.g. `band1 = src.read(1)`) and scale the values between 0 and 1 by dividing by the maximum value of a 16-bit integer (i.e. `band1 = src1.read(1) / 65536`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* d) Stack the bands and plot a true color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* e) Compute spectral index based on the RGB bands that emphasizes the water in the image. Once you have done that, make another plot (with a colorbar) to show your index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Hint\n",
    "Access the first band of the stacked variable using `rgb[:,:,0]`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* f) Export your spectral index as a GeoTIFF and open it in QGIS. If you were asked to distinguish between water and non-water pixels in your index, what threshold would you use? Note you can use the **Identify features** to obtain pixel values. \n",
