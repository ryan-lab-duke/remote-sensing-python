    "# Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To start this lab, we will need to install a Python distribution with the necessary packages. We recommend using `conda`, an open-source package management system which can be installed using Miniconda (a lightweight version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of Miniconda can be accessed from the [dowload page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). Scroll down a bit and download the appropriate **Miniconda** package for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test installation\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation is complete, you can test that the package manager `conda` works by opening an **Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the command prompt (or Terminal) run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the command returns a version number of conda (e.g. `conda 4.11.0`) everything is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create course environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python libraries needed for this course can be installed using an `environment.yml` file which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vq6yf1acpypdrf2/environment.yml?dl=0). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `environment.yml` by opening an Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), navigating to the file (i.e. `cd Downloads/`) and running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "More information about managing environments can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This may take some time so we recommend reading through the other lab materials while the packages are installing. But, if all goes well, you will have a new environment called `rs`. To activate this environment, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate rs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now launch `JupyterLab` by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once launched, we can make a new Jupyter Notebook to complete the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} images/jupyterlab.png\n",
    ":alt: jupyterlab\n",
    ":class: bg-primary mb-1\n",
    ":width: 1000px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    ", save it, and submit it on Canvas. The benefits of this approach are that this JupyterLab environment is permanent so it can be accessed without internet connection and will **not** shutdown after periods of inactivity.\n",
